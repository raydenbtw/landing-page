# landing-page

This is a project to replicate a webpage layout provided to me in the Foundations Course of The Odin Project.
I will be demonstrating the skills that I've learned in both HTML and CSS to closely replicate the desired outcome.
I will be able to position the different elements of the HTML document where I want them to be using CSS FlexBox.
